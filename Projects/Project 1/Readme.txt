There is a lot you can do before you build a machine learning algorithm, and not all data science problems require a fancy algorithmic solution. Using your data wisely to tell a story and find useful relationships is a very important part of the process, sometimes even more so than a fancy model.


Use one of the datasets below and do the following:
•    State the goal you aim to achieve, i.e. the main relationship you plan to investigate and why you think it is interesting/important to investigate it.
•    Import, if appropriate for the use case you chose merge, and clean the data.
•    Build different types of visualizations that you view appropriate (scatter, line plots, box plots etc). What conclusions do you draw from them? Use the visualizations wisely, they should enhance the story, not overload the reader/the person to whom you will present your results.
•    Find linear relationships in the data by using correlation plots. What story does the correlation plot tell you? What does it not?
•    Investigate distributions of features (you may want to start from the target).
•    Use hypothesis tests and regressions wisely to see if different groups in the data behave differently (you don’t need to test this for all features, only for a few which make sense to you).

Upload your Jupyter notebook with code, extensive comments and markdown sections. Imagine you are writing this for a business audience with little technical background. Even if they are not able to follow your code, your reasoning and conclusions should be clear and understandable. Always err on the side of providing more text and explanations rather than too little.
